# Neighborhood-Map

 ## What is this project about?
	I have bulit this application with Knockout JS and Google API services highlighting 5 of my favourite places using markers,    infoWindows etc

 ## How to Use the APP?
	* Open the index.html file in any browser to use the APP.
	* A search text box will be available for users to filter the locations
	* If user clicks on any of the particular location which have been displayed below search text box as a list then map will set a marker and center to the paticular location alone
	* If you click on the marker of a location it will display Checkincount list which i have fetched from FourSquare API along with location title
